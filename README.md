When providing your email address during a call, speak it using words like
"at", "dot", "underscore" or "dash". For example:

```
john dot doe at gmail dot com
```

The system will normalize these phrases to a proper email address when it
detects a match.

When a call begins you'll first be asked which property you want to bookâ€”the
**Jalapeno** or **The Bluebonnet**. Respond with the property name so the system
can continue with collecting your dates and other details.
